# eftbot
hello this is a basic python script, that just looking for thinks on your screen and if its founds a match it well press keys, this is made for eft skill farming, because getting max skills is annoying.

works with python 3.10

if u want the game to restart if it crashes you must keep the launcher open on game launch



you can skip all of this and just run the install python.bat file 
and then run the startheal.bat or startnoheal.bat depending if u want skills or just to die if u wish to use no heal it is recommended that you give yourself a heavyblead first.

 
pip install pyscreeze

pip install pywin32

pip install win32gui

pip install keyboard

pip install pyautogui

pip install opencv-python

pip install pillow --upgrade

pip install pydirectinput

should fix it
